# Notes:

## From Google Chat, Feb 18 (slightly corrected!):

me:  Hi Seamus - I'm sitting with Joost now (at a Lab-Wide meeting) and had a chance to ask about the project idea to include a graduate seminar project for you - basically the idea for work on business model and transition to self-sustainment for StateDecoded.   
Good news: It's a go.

me:  I'd thought you and he were in contact and planning since/after I sent the intro email, but he let me know he has been swamped and authorized/invited me to take lead on working with you to line up your project with the venture class

me:  Timing: This Thursday 10am-12pm is pitch-day.  So, I'd like one or more folks from StateDecoded to be join by Google Hangout (and/or in person if thats convenient) for about 10-15 min to explain what you are doing and invite collaboration. 
 What would be appropriate is a few ppt slides and brief remarks and the purpose is just excite enought Q&A/Interest to get some names of students who would like to follow up on a subsequent hangout and talk through possibly taking this on as a project.  Ideally, the slides/overview comments would describe who you are, what you are doing, what is needed to take it to the next step and - most importantly - the business model potential directions and the longer term/bigger picture profound nature of the opportunity to transform the legal field and interdependent economic sectors.     
 
Summary: I'm about to send an email update to you and Bill on status (as per above) and next steps.
